Archetype/Brain Region Legend
METABRAIN blends neuroscience with mythic symbolism. Each archetype corresponds to a real brain region, and AI guides signals along fiber paths to activate these sites during ritual.

Archetype	Linked Brain Region	Symbolic Function
Seeker	Hippocampus (Memory)	Quest for meaning, memory retrieval, personal narrative formation
Creator	Prefrontal Cortex	Imagination, decision-making, ritual design, symbolic synthesis
Warrior	Motor Cortex	Action, embodiment, ritual movement, protective activation
Visionary	Occipital & Parietal Lobes	Visual mapping, constellation decoding, spatial awareness
Eros	Amygdala (Emotion)	Emotional resonance, intimacy, vulnerability, sacred bonding
Connector	Temporal Lobe & Insula	Empathy, voice modulation, communal chorus, shared ritual flow
✨ Each ritual scene, glyph interaction, or soundscape in METABRAIN is designed to guide signals along these fiber paths, turning symbolic actions into targeted cognitive and emotional activation.
