## ✨ Wearable Glass integration — What it adds to METABRAIN

- **Hands‑free ritual immersion:** Voice, gaze, and subtle gestures become sacred triggers, freeing seekers from screens.
- **Archetype overlays:** Glyphs and constellation cues appear directly in the field of vision, blending myth with reality.
- **Adaptive sound + narration:** Ambient soundscapes and calm guidance synchronize with context for multi‑sensory healing.
- **Consent‑based memory echoes:** Optional “moments of intention” can be saved to the communal archive (privacy‑first).
- **Universal access:** Rituals can happen anywhere—quiet rooms, healing circles, outdoors—portable and embodied.
