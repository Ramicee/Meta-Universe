# Metabrain System  
A Neuro‑Symbolic Architecture for Adaptive Learning, Emotional Resonance, and Identity Pathways

## Overview
Metabrain is a neuro‑symbolic system that unifies AI mapping, user intention, and immersive delivery into a single adaptive architecture. It routes experiences through three internal layers—Mind, Metaheart, Spirit—using a Willpower‑Guided Fiber System and an Adaptive Memory Engine.

Metabrain is designed to run natively on Azure and can be implemented across web, mobile, and XR clients.

## Core Concepts

### Internal Layers
- **Mind Layer** — conceptual and analytical processing  
- **Metaheart Layer** — emotional and identity‑shaping processing  
- **Spirit Layer** — meaning, purpose, and coherence processing  

These layers are symbolic cognitive domains, not biological structures.

## System Architecture

### Key Components
- **Intention Interface Service**  
  Receives user’s target layer selection.

- **AI Mapping Engine**  
  Generates possible internal pathways based on content and user patterns.

- **Routing Orchestrator (Willpower‑Guided Fiber System)**  
  Combines AI mapping with user intention to select the final route.

- **Module Services**  
  - Mind Module  
  - Metaheart Module  
  - Spirit Module  

- **Adaptive Memory Engine**  
  Tracks and reinforces pathway usage patterns.

- **Immersive Delivery Service**  
  Generates final scene configuration for the client.

## Adaptive Loop
The core loop of Metabrain:

```
AI proposes → Willpower directs → Memory reinforces → AI adapts
```

This creates personalized cognitive‑emotional pathways over time.

---

## Data Model (High‑Level)

### UserPatternProfile
Tracks layer weights and template usage.

### ExperienceDefinition
Defines content and available symbolic templates.

### RouteSelectionLog
Stores pathway selections for adaptive reinforcement.

---

## API Sketch

### POST /intention/select-layer
Routes an experience to a target layer.

### GET /user/pattern-profile/{user_id}
Returns adaptive pattern profile.

### POST /experience/render
Orchestrates mapping → routing → module → delivery.

---

## Immersive Delivery
The client receives a `scene_config` JSON describing:

- scene type  
- symbolic template  
- color palette  
- motion profile  
- symbolic elements  
- text overlays  

The client renders the scene using WebGL, Unity, Unreal, or any immersive framework.

## Implementation Priorities (Prototype)

1. Basic UI for layer selection  
2. Rule‑based AI Mapping Engine  
3. Routing Orchestrator with simple weighting  
4. Adaptive Memory Engine storing layer counts  
5. Immersive Delivery returning JSON scene configs  
6. Client rendering symbolic scenes per layer

## Status
Metabrain is now fully defined at the architectural, conceptual, and technical levels.  
This repository structure and documentation provide a clear foundation for prototype development.
